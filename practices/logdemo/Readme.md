# Try Co-log
Inside this, I start to simulate some users cases of Co-log. I will try to use the library in a simple way, and then I will try to use it in a more complex way.

## Cases
### 1. Parse flags
**Goal**:
- Support flags: help flag `-h`, verbose flag `-v`, debug flag `-d` and the optional factor `-f` which will multiply the factorial calculation.
- The program will receive a number input and calculate the factorial of that number.



### 2. Parse flags with log
