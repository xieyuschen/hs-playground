# Motivation
I use chatgpt daily nearly, however, the browser one doesn't work well, especially at some points:
- expire time is too short, I have to refresh the page frequently.
- could not pre-define some prompts, like refining my English expression and so on.
- could not use it in the shell.

Frankly, there are some libraries already for those requirements, but I want to try Haskell and written it by myself.


# Requirement
- written by haskell
- could use it in the shell.
- have a context feature(optional).
